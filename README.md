# MovieCatalog
A C# WPF (MVVM) desktop application for cataloging watched movies.

## Technology
C# WPF for client side code
MSSQL for database (hosted locally)

## Usage:
The user can add watched movies to the data base via the "add movie" button. Information, such as Movie Title, Director, Actor(s), Date Watched and Rating will be saved to the database.

## An updated TODO board can be found on my notion:
